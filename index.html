I signed up for <br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I excelled shortly thereafter.The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</h4>

I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former student of their's<br> who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team projects, in<br> particular, were outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>fact I've often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my <br>development experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 100% recommended."</h4>
